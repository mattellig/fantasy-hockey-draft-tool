# Fantasy hockey draft tool

This is a small web app that\'s built to help with value-based drafting for fantasy hockey. It was made in React with TypeScript.

## Instructions

To install this app on your computer, clone the repository and install dependencies.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mattellig/fantasy-hockey-draft-tool.git
$ cd fantasy-hockey-draft-tool
$ npm install
```

Once dependencies have finished installing, you can start the app.

```
$ npm run dev
```

There is a sample file ([sample.csv](/public/sample.csv)) that contains 250 players and their Yahoo projections for the 2021-2022 NHL season. This is provided for two reasons:

1. To allow you to preview the tool and see how it works without providing your own data, and
2. To give you the expected format for when you would like to use your own data

If you\'d like to actually use the tool for your draft, I highly recommend finding more complete and up-to-date data to use instead of the sample.
